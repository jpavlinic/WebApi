🛠️ WebAPI Project

A Java-based Web API that enables full CRUD operations with a database, following clean coding principles and leveraging an external JAR file for the data layer.

🔥 About the Project

This project is a Java-based Web API that allows CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a database. The unique aspect of this project is its separation of layers, with a clear distinction between the Business Layer, Service Layer, and Data Layer. The Data Layer is managed by an external JAR file, which acts as the interface for database communication.
The API exposes endpoints for POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET requests, offering full functionality for manipulating the data. The project follows industry-standard programming principles, ensuring clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
